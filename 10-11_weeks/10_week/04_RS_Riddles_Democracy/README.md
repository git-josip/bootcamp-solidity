# RareSkills Riddles - Democracy

If we as challenger vote immidiatelly we will not win, as we have 2 NFTs and when we vote we will have total number of NFTs >= `TOTAL_SUPLY_CAP (10)` .
We will do the trick and trasfer 1 NFT to other user and vote with our 1 token. Then Transfer second NFT as well to other user and then do the vote with 2 tokens from that user , which will make total votes for our challnger to be 6, which is bigger than 5. 
We won.
