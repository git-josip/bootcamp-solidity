# Wrapped NFT

A wNFT (wrapped NFT) is an upgraded NFT with expanded functionality such as economic set-up, on-chain royalties, rental mechanism, time/value/event-locks, protection of devaluation, and anti-fraud system. I also call it NFT 2.0 which tends to evolve the principles and rules of fundraising in particular and several other industries in general.

There are numerous competitive advantages of wNFT technology to traditional NFTs. Thanks to this format, NFTs wrapped into collateral can be given without worrying about a possible dump of its tokens (ERC/BEP-20) and can define a preferred time lock setup.
